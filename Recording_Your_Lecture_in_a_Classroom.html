        Bryn Mawr subscribes to a lecture capture service called Panopto, which is designed
        to make it easy for people to record lectures and talks and post the recordings for 
        others to view them. Panopto can simultaneously capture audio and video of a person 
        lecturing and a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screencast">screencast</a> of 
        what they project overhead from the podium computer during a lecture. Recordings are automatically
        uploaded to Panopto's servers and can be shared with students via a course Moodle site or with 
        viewers outside of a course via a public link. Want to <a href="https://techdocs.blogs.brynmawr.edu/8248">

    <h3>
        Getting Ready to Record
    </h3>
    <p>
        Not all rooms are equipped for lecture capture. If you need to record a talk or classes,
        be sure to schedule the event or the course in a room that is:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Go to the <a href ="https://www.brynmawr.edu/lits/spaces/technology-enabled-classrooms">
                Technology Enhanced Classrooms</a> web page.
            </li>
            <li>
                Look up your building.
            </li>
            <li>
                Find a room that has a "Lecture Capture Camera" in the listing under
                <b>
                    Cameras/Mics
                </b>.
            </li>
        </ol>
        Most lecture-style classrooms are equipped for lecture capture. Seminar style classrooms and
        meeting rooms typically are <i>not</i> set up for lecture capture.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will also need to have to have a Teacher role in a Moodle site in order to record
        lectures. (Any Moodle site will do, it doesn't have to be an academic course-related site.)
        If you don't have one already, please <a href = mailto:help@brynmawr.edu>e-mail help@brynmawr.edu</a>.

    <h3>
        Starting a Recording
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Turn on the classroom computer and log in.
        </li>
        <li>
           Open any applications and diles that you will use to during your lecture. For example,
           if you wanted to show PowerPoint slides, a web page, and an image in a PDF document, you would open
           your PowerPoint file, your web browser, and the PDF file. 
        </li>
    <p>
        <i>
            <b>
                Note:
            </b>
            Panopto will use all of the RAM, cache space, and processing power available when
            it is launched. Opening your presentation materials before opening Panopto ensures that
            computer resources are reserved for those processes.
        </i>
    </p>
        <li>
            Launch the Panopto recorder, of which tehre are two options to do so. You can either:
            1) open the Panopto desktop app that is installed on all campus computers or 2) login to

                Note: in many rooms, the video camera mounted in the ceiling is the only
                audio input source. In these cases, you will need to enable <b>Instructor Video</b>
                in order to record audio even if you only wanted a narrated screencast.
